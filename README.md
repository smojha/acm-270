# ACM 270 Project: Data-Driven Modeling of Dynamical Systems

This project investigates data-driven approaches for modeling nonlinear dynamical systems, using both operator-theoretic and neural network-based methods. The goal is to evaluate how different modeling strategies perform in learning complex system behavior from time series data.

## Objectives

* Compare Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) and Neural ODEs on classic dynamical systems.
* Quantitatively assess model performance using RMSE over time across multiple initial conditions.
* Analyze the impact of system complexity (e.g., chaotic vs. structured dynamics) on learnability and model generalization.

## Modeling Approaches

* **Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD):** A Koopman operator-based method that lifts nonlinear dynamics into a higher-dimensional linear space.
* **Neural ODEs:** Gradient-based models that learn a continuous-time vector field using neural networks and backpropagation through ODE solvers.

## Systems Studied

* **Lotka-Volterra:** A predator-prey system with linearly immersible dynamics — relatively structured and easier to model.
* **Lorenz Attractor:** A chaotic system with nonlinear, sensitive dynamics — presents challenges for both generalization and stability.

## Dataset Generation

* Simulated ground-truth data using high-precision Runge-Kutta solvers.
* For each system, 10 trajectories were generated by randomly sampling initial conditions from a uniform distribution over the system's state space.

## Evaluation

* **Scoring Metric:** RMSE at each time step $t \in [0, T]$ averaged over $M = 10$ test trajectories:

$$\text{RMSE}[t] = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{M} \left\| \hat{x}^{(i)}[t] - x^{(i)}[t] \right\|_2^2 }$$

* Visualizations include:
   * Time series comparison (true vs. predicted)
   * RMSE plots per trajectory and averaged across trajectories
   * 3D vector field alignment using directional arrows (Lorenz system)
